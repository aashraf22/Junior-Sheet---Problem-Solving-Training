# Problem Solving Training
My solutions to Mostafa Saad's sheet and some external peroblems to train and improve problem solving skill and learning Algorithms.

What is this sheet?
- To be a strong contestant, one has to take care of a number of quality and quantitiy factors.
   * This roadmap does its best to satisfy that.
- Complete and consistent roadmap : What to solve & algorithms to learn in order.
- Covering all topics needed up to codeforces Div2-D.
- Speed problems to maintain speed goals.
- Learn important and major algorithms.
